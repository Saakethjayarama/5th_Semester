# connect

- connect()
- connects to the service
- connect is called by a client to connect to a server port
- int connect(int socket_id, (struct sockaddr \*)&server_addr, socklen_t len);
- socket_id - a socket returned by socket()
- server_addr - a socketadr_in struct pointer (filled with all the remote server details and cast as a sockaddr struct pointer)
- len - size of server_addr struct

# send/recv

- send(), recv(), read(), write() calls are used to send and receive data.
- int send(int socket_id, void \*msg, size_t len, int flags)
- int recv(int socket_id, void \*msg, size_t len, int flags)
- flags = 0
- msg is msg u want to send
- len size of msg

- The return value is the number of bytes actualoly sent or received.

```
char send_buffer[512];
char recv_buffer[512];
int sent_bytes;
int recv_bytes;

sent_bytes = send(socket_id, send_buffer, 512, 0)
recv_bytes = recv(socket_id, recv_buffer, 512, 0)


```

# close

- close()
- signals the end of communication between a server and client.
- This effectively closes the socket.
- int close(int socket_id);
- socket_id is the socket to close.

```
 close(socket_id)
```
