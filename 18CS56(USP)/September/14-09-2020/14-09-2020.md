# Files

- The file is a container for storing informatino.
- File size is not stored inside the file and not even its name.
- All the file attributes are kept in a separate area of the hard disk which is accessable only to the kernel
- Unix treats directories and devices as files
- Files are divided into 3 categories

  - Ordinary file
    - text file(all files, i.e, printable characters ie 1 to 128 ascii characters)
    - binary file(compiled files, also contains extended ascii characters)
  - Direcotry file
  - Device file

- . -> current directory

```
    cat ./x.txt -> prints x.txt from same folder
```

- .. -> parent directory

```
    cat ../x.txt -> prints x.txt from parent folder
```

# Absolute and relative path

- paths relative to current directory are known as relative paths
- paths with respect to root / are known as absolute paths
