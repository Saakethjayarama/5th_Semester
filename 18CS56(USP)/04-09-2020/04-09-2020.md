- hardwae kernel (shell, csh, bash, ksh) (cat, wget, ls, utilitites, nano, vim)

# Man

## Different sections awailable in manual

1. Executable programs or shell commands

# Diffference between kernel and shell

## Kernel

- It is the core of the computer os
- It has control over the complete system
- it controls all the tasks or precesses of the system
- Des not have type

## Shell

- It is an interface between kernel and user
- It has only limited acess to the operating system
- Has types such as bourse shell, c shell, korn shell, bourne again shell..etc

# System calls vs library function

- fopen - lib fn -returns file pointer
- open() = system call - returns file descripter
- Ex of sys calls:- read/write fork/exec
- Ex of lib fn:- date/time strcpy/atoi/printf

# sys call vs lib fn

## sys call

- not portable
- there are modes
- slower than lib call
- have more previleges
- ex fork exec

## lib call

- portable
- no mode
- faster than sys call
- lib calls have less priv than sys call
- fopen fclose scanf printf

# unix commands

1. internal command

- built into the shell
- the shell oes not create a separate processs to run internal cmd
- ex echo pwd
- similaly, variable assignment with the stmt x = 5

2. external cmd

- stored in /bin

3. shell script
