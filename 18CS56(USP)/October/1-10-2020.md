- Conditional branching is of 3 types
  - 1st form
    ```
        if command is successfull
        then
            execute commands
        else
            execute commands
        fi
    ```
  - 2nd form
    ```
        if command is successful
        then
            execute commands
        fi
    ```
  - 3rd form
    ```
        if command is successful
        then
            execute commands
        elif
            command is successful
        then ...
        else ...
        fi
    ```

```
x=5
y=7
z=5
test $x -eq $y; echo $?
1
test $x -eq $z; echo $?
0
# -eq -equal
# -lt -lessthan
# -gt -greaterthan
# -ne - note equal to
# -le - less than or equal to
# -ge - greater than or equal to

short hand format for test using []
test $x -eq $z
[$x -eq $z]

```

```
String comparision
s1 = s2
s1 != s2
-n str str is not null
```

- using test and [] to evalueae exprs.
- when you use if to evaluate exprs, you need to test the statement because the true or false values returned by expr cannot be directly handled by if
- test uses certain operatorrs to execute the condition on its right and returns either a true or false exit status, which is then used by if for making decisions.

- test works in three ways
  - compares 2 numbers
  - compares 2 strings or a single one or a null value
  - checks a files attributes

# File related tests

- -f file exists
- -r readable
- -w writable
- -x executable
- -d directory ?
- f1 nt f2 - newer than
- f1 ot f2 - older than
- f1 -ef f2 -linked to

```
if [ ! -e $1 ]; then
    echo "File not found"
elif [ ! -r $1 ]; then
    echo "File not readable"
elif [ ! -w $1 ]; then
    echo "File not writable"
else
    echo "File is readable and writable"
fi
```

# Case statement

- The statement matchs an expr for more than one alternative , and uses a compact construct to permit multi way branching. case handles string tests in a more efficient manner than if.
- The general syntax of the case statement is as follows.
- syntax

  ```
  case expr in
      patttern1) commands1;;
      pattern2) commands2;;
  esac
  ```

- example
  ```
      echo "   MEnu    \n
      1. List of files\n
      2. List of users\n
      3. Todays data\n
      0. Quit\n"
      read choice
      case $choice in
          1) ls -ls;;
          2) who;;
          3) date;;
          0) exit;;
      esac
  ```

# Matching multiple patters

- Case can also specify the same action for more than one pattern
- Programmers frequently encounter a logic that has to test a user responses for both y and Y or N and n.

```
echo "Do you wish to continue? (y/n) :\c"
read answer
case $answer in
    y|Y) echo "y/Y entered";;
    n|N) echo "n/N entered";;
```

# Wild cards

- case has a feature that uses wild cards.
- it uses filename matching metachars \* and ? etc

```
case $answer in
    [yY][eE]*) echo "Yes is entered";; Yes, yES, yeS, yes, YES,
    [nN][oO]) echo "No is entered";; no, NO, nO, No,
esac
```
