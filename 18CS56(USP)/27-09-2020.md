dos2unix and unix2dos
dos = windows

Converting bw dos and unix.
dos/windows -EOL is singalled by 2 chars. \r and \n.
Unix files use only \n.

CR, LF cobmination is represented by octal val

dos2unix foo.dos foo.unix

# Compressing and archiving ifles

- to conserve disk space, you have to compresss large and infrequently used files.
- Before sending email attachments, it is usual practice to compress the file.
- gzip and gunzip => .gz, bzip2 and bunzip2 => .bz2, zip and unzip => .zip

```
gzip x.txt y.txt

```

# tar

- For creating a disk archive, that contains a group of files or even entire directory. we need to use tar

## options

- -c: Create an archive
- -x: extract files from archive
- -t: display the files of archive
- -f: specify archive

## create an archive

```
tar -cvf x.tar a.txt b.txt
```

## extracting the files

```
tar -xvf x.tar
a.txt
b.txt
```

## view the contents of a tar file

```
tar -tvf x.tar
displays the content of tar files
```

## compressing and archiving together

- zip x.zip a.txt b.txt
- unzip x.zip, -v for verbose

# File attributes

- fileattr, link, owner, group, size, lastmodified date, filename

# Link (ln)

- linux can provide multiple names to a physical file

```
cat > f1.txt
Saaketh
ctrl +d

ls -ls f1.txt
links as 1

//creating a link

ln f1.txt f2.txt
ln f1.txt f3.txt

gedit f3.txt
add lien and exit

file altered f3.txt
and so is f1.txt and f2.txt

//removing a link
rm -f2.txt
ls -ls f1.txt
so links is 2


ls -i f1.txt
164830 is inode
all there links also have same inode number since inode refers to the physical file.
```

# Changing file permissions

- owner, grp, others
- owner -> user
- default permission -> umask to get default permission which is 0002

# chmod

- chmod command is used to set the permissions of one or more files for all three categories of users (user, group, others)
- it can be run only by the owner and super user
- This command may be used in 2 ways.
  - relative manner
    - by specifying the changes to the current permissions
  - absolute manner
    - by specifying the fianl permissions

## relative permission

- when changing permissions in a relative manner, chmod only changes the permissions specified in the command line and leaves the other permissions unchanged.
- syntax:=

  ```
      chmod category operation permission filename(s)
      expr - category, operation, permission (all these together called as expressiong)

      User Category (user, grop and others)
      operation (assign, revoke a permission)
      type of permission (read, write, execute)
  ```

- example

  ```
      chmod u+x x.txt
      // gives execute permission to the user
      + -> assign
      - -> revoke

      chmod u-x x.txt
      // remove execute permission to the user

      chmod ugo+x x.txt
      // add execute permission of user group and other permission

      chmod a+x x.txt
      // add exec to all users

      chmod +w x.txt
      // we have not specified to whom so by default all

      //chmod accepts multiple filenames in the command line.

      chmod u+x x.txt y.txt z.txt
      // give ex permission for user for multiple files

      // chmod also accepts multiple expr delimited by commas.

      chmod a-x, go+r x.txt

  ```

## absolute permissions

- sometimes you do not need to know what a files current permissions are, but want to set all nine permissions bits explicitly.
- The expression used by chmod here is a string of 3 octal numbers(base 8)
  - octal digit 0-7
- set of 3 bits represent one octal digit.
  - read 100
  - write 010
  - execute 100
    - ex 111 => read, write, exec
    - 110 read, write
    - 011 write, execute
- usage chmod 761 x.txt
  111 - user rwx
  110 - grp rw
  001 - x

# Dir permissions

- mkdir <dir>
- ls -ld <dir>

# changing file ownership

- chown -change ownership

```
    chown <owner name> <filename>
```

- chgrp changing grp

```
    chgrp cse x.txt
```
