# Characteristics of relation

- Ordering of tuples ina relation
  - The tuples re not ordered, tho in tabular form
- Ordering of attr in relation schem R (and of values within each tuple):
  - We will consider the attr in R(A1, A2, ..., An) and the values in t=V1, ...vn to be ordered.
    - However, a more general alternative defn of relaiton does not requuire this ordering.
- Values in tuple:
  - All values are considered atomic(indivisible).
  - Each val in tuple must be form the domain of the attr for that col
  - A spcl null value is used to represent values that are unknown or inapplicable to certain tuples.
- Notation:
  - we refer to comp val of a tuple t by:
    - t[Ai] or t.Ai
    - This is val vi of attr Ai of tuple t
  - Similarly t[Au, Av, Aw] refers to the subtuple of t containing the values of attr Au, Av ...

# Relational integrity constraints

- Constrainst are cond that must hold on all valid realtion states.
- There are three main types of constr
- key constraint
- entity integrity constr
- referential integrity constraints

# key constraints

- Superkey of R
  - Is a set of attributes SK of R with the following condition:
    - no tuples in any valid relation state r(R) will have the same value of SK
    - That is, for any distinct tuples t1 and t2 in r(R), t1[SK] != t2[SK]
    - This cond must hold in any valid state r(R)
- Key of R:
  - A "minimal" super key
  - That is, a key is a superkey K such that removal of any attr from K results in a set of attr that is not a superkey(does not possess the superkey uniqueness property)
