# Categories of Data model

## conceptual (high level, semantic) data models:

- provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data
  - Aslo callded enitty based or obj based data models

## physical (lowlevel internal)data models:

- Provide concpets that dwscribe detaisl of how data is strd in comp

## Representational data models

- provides concepts undestood by end users

# Scgemas vs instances

### Database schema

- The description of a database\
- includes descriptions of the database structure, data types, and the constraints on the database

### Schema diagram

- illustrarive description of db schema

### schema construct

- component of obj of schema is schema construct

### db state

- actual data sotred in particular mioment in time.
- includes collection of all the data
- also called db instance(or occurrence or snapshot).

# Db schema vs db state

## db state

- refers content of db at a momnent

## db state

- refers to the db state when it is initially loaded into the sys

## valid state

- a state that satisfies the structure and constrainst

## Schema and state distinciton

- The db schema changes very inffrequently. The db state changes every time the db is updated
- schema is also called intension whereas state is also called extension.

# 3 schema architecture

- proposed to achieve the db characteristics
  - to sperarte user applications and physical db
- defins schemas at 3 levels
  - internal schema
    - to describe physical storage structure and acces pahts
    - low level data model
  - conceptual schema
    - describe the structure whole db for community of users.
    - hides physical storage structure
    - cons on enitties, data tyeps, realtionships and constraints
  - extenal schema
    - the db that a particular user grp is interested in and hides rest of db from usr grp
    - uses same model as conceptual schema

# Data independence

- the ablility to change the schema at one level of the db system without having to change the schema at the next higher level.
  - Logical data independence
    - Changeing conceptual schema without having to change extenal shcmeaas and their associated application programs
  - physical Data independence
    - internal shcmea change but no conceptual schema

Question: -Discuss three schema architecture with neat diagram

# DBMS languages

## Data defn language

- define db schema. indentify description of the schema construct and sotre the schema description in the dbms catalog.

## data manipulation lang

- a lang used to manipulate(retireve, insert, delete, and modify) data.
  - A high level or non procedural dml can be used on its own to specify complex db operations in a concise manner, such as sql
  - a low level or procedural dml retireves individual records or objects from the db and processes each separetely such as pl/sql\
  - embedded lang:- DML with java, vb, c++, etc.

# DBMS Interfaces

- Stand alon query lang interfaces
  - ex:- entering sql queries at the dbms interactive sql interface
- programmer interfaces for embedding dml in programming lang
- USer friendly interfaces
  - menu based, popular for browsing on the web
  - forms based, designed for naive users
  - graphoics based
  - natuaral lang requests in englinsh
  - parametric interface
