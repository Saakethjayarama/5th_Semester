# Data abstractions

    - Hiding internal details and showing details what are necessay
    - The suppression of details of data organization and storage and the highlighting of essential features for better understanding

# Data model:

    - set of concepts to describe the strructure od a db, and certain constrains that the db shld obey.
    - data model helps to achieve data abstration

# Categories of Data model

## Conceptual(high-level, semantic) data model

- Provide conceepts that are close to the way many users perceive data
  - also called entity basesd or dobject based data models.

## Physical(low level, internal) data model

- provide concepts that describe details of how data is stored in the computer

## REpresentational(Implementation) data models:

- PRovide concepts that may be understood by end users but that are not too different from the way data is organized within the computer
- Hide some details of data storage but can be implemented on a computer system in a direct way
- Used by many commercial dbms implementations(e.g. relational data models used in many commercial systems).

# Schmas vs instances

# Datbase schema

- The description of a db.
- Includes description of the datbase structure, data types, and the constraints on the db

# schema diagram

    - An illustrative display of database schema

tables - Schema construct
schema construct consists of fields (cols)

# schema construct

- A component of the dschema or an object within the schema

# Database state

- The actual data consisting at particular instant of time
- database snapshot

# inital db state

- Refers to the db state when it is initially laded into the system

# Valid state

- The state satisfies the sturcture and constraints of the db

# schema and state distinction

- The db schema changes very infrequently. The db state changes every time the4 db is updated
- Schema is also called intension whereas state is also called extension
