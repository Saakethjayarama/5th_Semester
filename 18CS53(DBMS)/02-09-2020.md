## Main characteristics of db approach
1. Self describing nature of db system
* A dbms catalog stores description of particular db(eg, data structure, types, constraints) called as metadata
<img goes here>
* allows dbms sw to work with different db applications

2. Insulation between programs and data
* called program-data indeppendence
* allows chaningn data structure and storage organization without having to change the dbms access programs
* program operation independence
3. Data Abstraction
4. Support of multiple views of the data
* Each user may see a different view of the database, which descibes only the data of interest to thtat user.
5. Sharing of data and multi user transaction processing
* Allow a set of concurrent user to retrieve from and to update the db
* concurrency control withing dbms guarantees that each transaction is correctly executed or aborted
* Recovry subsys ensures each completed transaction has its efffect permanently recoreded in the db
* OLTP(online transaction processing) is a major part of db applications. this allows hundereds of concurrent transactions to execute pre sec.

## Database users
USers may be divided into:-
* users who actually use and control the db content, and those who design, develop and maintain db applications called actors on the scene
* those who design and devlope the dbms sw and related tools and the computer sys operators(called workers behind the scene)

### Actorrs on schene
1. Db admins:
    * responsible for authorize access to the db for coordinating and monitoring its use, acquiring sw and hw resources, controlling its use and monitoring efficiency of operations
2. Database Designers:
    * Responsible to identifying the content, defining the structure, the constraints, or functions of the db. They must communicate with the end users and understand their needs.

### Categories of End users
1. End users: They use the data for queries, reports and some of them update the db content.
2. End users are divided into
    * Casual: access db occasionally when they needed and may need different data each time.
    * Naive or parametric: they make up a large section of the end user population
        1. Theya re previosly well defined fncn in the form of "canned transactions" against the db
        2. Ex are bank tellers or reservation clerks who do this activity for an entire shift of operations.
    * Sophisticated:
        1. These include business analysts, scientists, engineers, who are thorougly familira witht the sys capabilities
    * Stand alone
        1. Mostly personal db using ready to use pkged application
        2. ex tax program user
        3. maintain address book
### Sys analyst and application programmer


### Workers behind the scene
1. DBMS System designers
2. Tool Developers
3. Operatior and maintenance personnel
