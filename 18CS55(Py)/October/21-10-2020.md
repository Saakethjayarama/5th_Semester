# Using regex

- regular expressions => regexes
- \d -> 0-9
  - \d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d -> phone number
  - \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

# Regular expression objects

- re module
- re.compile() returns a regex pattern object. (Regex object)

```
phoneNumberRegex = re.compile(r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}')

```

- search() searches the string it is passed for any matches to the regex.
- returns None if the reges pattern is not found in the string.
- returns a Match object, if the pattern is found.
- Match objects have a group() method that will return the actual matched text from the searched string.

```
phonenumregex = re.compile(r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}')
mo = phonenumregex.search('My number is 415-555-4242')
print(mo.group()) ->gives matched pattern.
```

1. import re
2. re.compile
3. search
4. mo.group

# More pattern matching with regex

- grouping with parentheses
- adding parentheses will create groups in the regex: (\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)
- use match ob gropu to grab the marching text from the grp of pattern

```
415-555-6556
mo.group(1)
returns first thing in parenthesis 415

mo.group(2)
return 5555

mo.group(3)
returns 6565

to add parenthesis add escape \

```

# matching multiple grps with the pipe

- pipe -> |
- use pipe anywhere you want to match one of many expr
- ex 'Bat|Ball'
- if both matches 1st occurence is returned on group

# optional matching(?)

- batregex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)?man')
- mo = batregex.search('The adventures of Batman')
- .group() -> Batman
- mo = batregex.search('The adventures of Batwoman')
- .group() -> BatWoman
