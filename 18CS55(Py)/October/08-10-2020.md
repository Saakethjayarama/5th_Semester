# tuples

- immutable
- like list
- comparable, hashable
- comma separated list of values and enclose with parenthesis which is not mandatory
- another wayt to construct is using tuple fn t = tuple() creates empty tuple
- t = tuple('Saaketh') >>> t >>> ('S', .... 't')
- most list operators also work on tuples. The brkt operator indexes an element
- tuple val cna be changed using concatenation t = ('A') + t[1:]

# comparision of tuples

- comarision operators work with tuples and other sequence.
- (0,1,2) < (3,4,5) => True
- (0,1,2000)< (0,3,4) => True
- if any one comparision is true then it evaluates true
- sort works the same way
- DSU: -decorate seq by building list of tuples one or more sort keys preceding the ele from sequence, sort using py builtin sort, undecorate by extracting the sorted ele of the seq
- ex

  ```
      txt = 'but soft what light in yonder window breaks';
      //decorate
      words = txt.split()
      t = list()

      for word in words:
          t.append((len(word), word))
      //sort
      t.sort(reverse=True)

      //undecorate
      res = list()
      for length, word in t:
          res.append(word)
      print(res)
  ```

# dictionary

- data type
- indexes of this type can by of any type not necessrily to be int
- these indexes are called keys
- the key and associated value is called key-value pair
- enclosed with {} and separaed by ,
