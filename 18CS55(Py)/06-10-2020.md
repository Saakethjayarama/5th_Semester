spam.sort(key=str.lower) (case insensitive sort)

# The tuple data type

- The tuple data type is almost identical to the list dt
- tuples are typed with parenthesis, ( and ), instead of []
- Immutable

# copy and deppcopy

- if a fn modifies the list or dict that is passed, we if dont want thesee changes int the original list of dict value
- python module named copy that provides both the copy and deepcopy fns
- The first of these, copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dict, not just a copy of a reference.

```
import copy
spam = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
cheese = copy.copy(spam)
cheese[1] = 42
spam
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
cheese
[42, 'B', 'C', 'D']

```

```
str1 = 'String11'
result = str1[0:2] + str1[-2:]
if len(str1) < 2:
    str1+$
```
