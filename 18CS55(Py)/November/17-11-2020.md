# attributes

```
    class Rectangle:
        attributes: width, height, corner


    box = Rectange()
    box.widht = 100
    box.height = 200
    box.corner = Point()
    box.corner.x = 15
    box.corner.y = 23

```

# instances as return values

```
def move_rectange(rect, dx, dy):
    rect.corner = rect.corner.x + dx
    rect.corner = rect.corner.y + dy
    return rect
```

# copying

```

import copy
p2 =  copy.copy(p1)
p1 and p2 contain the same data, but they are not the same point.
p1 is p2 => false
p1 == p2 => false

! This doesn't copy the embedded object
So this is shallow copy so to overcome it obj2 = copy.deepcopy(obj)

```
