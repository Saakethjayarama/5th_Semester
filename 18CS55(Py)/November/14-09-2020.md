# functions

- like a min program within a prgram
- starts with def keyword fn name parenthesis and a colon
- after colon body of the strm starts
- this code is executed when fn is called
- fn call helo()

# local and global scop

- parameters and vars that are assigned in c called fn exist in local scp
- var outside all fns exist in global scp
- code in global scp cannot use any local vars
- however a local scp can acewss global vars
- code in a fns local scope cannot user vars in any othr local scope
- you can use the same name for diff vars if they are in different scopes

# the global statement

- if we need to modify global va from within a fn use global stmt

# rules to tell whthr a var is local or global scope

- if a var is being used ina the global scope (outside all fns), then it is always a global var
- if there is a global stmt for that var in a fn it is a global var
- Otherwise, if the var is used in an assignment stmt in the fn it is a local var
- But if the var is not used ina n at it is a global var

# Exception handling

- we wwant tthe program to detect errors, handle them, and then continue to run.
