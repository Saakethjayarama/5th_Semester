# Methods

```
__init__ (self) // like a constructor
__str__(self) // toString method
__add__(self, other) // where other is the other obj's self
```

- Changin the behavior of an operatior so that it works with programmer fdefined types is called operator overloading
- isInstance(obj, class)
- Type based dispatch
- The problem is, instead of asking the time object to add and integer, python is asking an integer to add a time object, and it doesnt' know how

```
__radd__ -> right-side add

```

# Polymorphism

- Type based dispatch is useful when it is nec3essary, but it is not always nec3ssary.
- Fns that work withserveral types are called polymorphic.
