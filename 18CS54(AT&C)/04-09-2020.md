# Symbol

- An alphabet is a nont empty, finite set of characters/symbols

- Use Sima to denota an alphabet
  Example
  sigma = {a, b}
  sigma = {0,1,2}
  sigma = {a, b, c,...,Z}
  sigma = {#, \$, \*, @, &}

- Epsilon or lambda is used for empty string

# Strings

- A string is a finite sequence of characters drawn from some alphabet sigma.
- A string is finite sequence of characters from an alhabet sigma

# Functions of strings

- epsilon is the empty string
- {a,b} {a, b}\*
- sigma\*\* is the set of all possible strings over
- |s| denotes length of the string
- w represents string
- #c(s) # count and c indicates character
- Concategnation: teh concatenation of 2 strings s and t is the string formed b appending t to s; written as s||t or more commonly, st
- epsilon.s == s.epsilon == s
- (st)w = s(tw)
- w^0 = epsilon
- w^k+1 = w^k w
- a^3 = aaa
- REverse it is string obtained by writing the symbols of s in reverse order represented by w^r
- (wr)^z = (w^z)(r^z)
- epsilon is always a substring of everystring  
  slide 9
- 2^|s| substrings
- prefixes
- proper prefixes

# Language

- Alanguage is a set of strings over an alphapbet sigma
- fi the lang with no strings in it
- {epsilong} the lang with empty string
- sigma \* is countabiliy infinate
- sigma _ is defined as the set of all possible strings that can be formed from the alphabet sigma _
- the smallest lang over any sigma is fi
- count is 0
