# Automata Theory and Computability
    Abstract metod      computation

## Earlier
* abacus
* Manually
* Vedic math

## Automata
* Automata is an abstract machine for modeling computation. Abstract machine allow us to model essential parameters and ignoring non essential parameters.State machines

## Computability
* Solve a problem in an effective manner.

* Computable :- Soln can be obtained
* Non Computable :- Soln cant be obtained
* Computable but useless :- Not efficient enough to solve the problem
* Tractable and intractable problems :- Can be solved in polynomial amount of time and Exponential or factorial amount of time respectively

## Application
* Design of compiler(lexical analysis(verify tokens), Syntax analysis)
* Modeling the circuit design
* Word Search

## Why natural langs are not used as prog langs
* Context free and context sensitive

## Various types of automata
* DFA, PDA, LBA, TM
