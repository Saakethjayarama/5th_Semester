# Power of an alphabet

# Finite State machines regular languages

# Languages and Machines

# REgular language

- Regular Expression -> defines
- Regular grammer
- Finite machine -> accepts

# Finite state machine(FSM)

- Computational device having a string as input and having one of 2 possible outputs
- accept or reject

# Example finite state machine

- Incoing arrow indicates start state
- Double circles -> accepting state
- Single circles -> Rejecting state
- Note: time required <= |String|
- Initial state, trap state

# Formal Definition of a DFSM

## Determinitstic Finite State Machine (DFSM) is M:

- M = (k, sigma, delta, s, A), where:
  k finite set of state
  sigma is an alphabet
  s beloongs to k is the init state
  a subset k is the set of accepting states

* is the transition fn from (K X singma) to K
* The set of All Strings accepted by M form the Language defined by the DFSM

# Configurations of DFSMs

- A configuration of a dfsm M is an ele of K X sigma\*

# Transition function - delta

- Defines the dfsm, one state ata a time
- delta is set of all pairs of states in M and characters in sigma
  (Curerent State, Current character) -> New State
- Note: we often reduce the set of delta to those pairs that are useful or to only those that can lead to an accepting state.

# Complete vs Incomplete FSM

## Complete fsm

- transition for evry possible state and evry possible char in alpha
- Can cause fsm to be larger than necessary, but always processes the entire string

# Incomplete fsm

# The yeilds relation

# computations using fsm

# Accepting and Rejecting
