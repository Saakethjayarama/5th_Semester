# Defining language

- A language is a set of strings over an alphabet sigme.

L = {b, ba, baa, baaa, baaa, ...}
L = {a, ab, ba, fi}

- Let sigma = {a,b}
- Some language over sigma
- fi = the language with no strings in it
- {epsilong} = the langugage containing empty string
- sigma \* is defined as the set of all possible strings that can be formed from the alphabet sigma\*
- sigma\* is a language
- Remmeber we are defining a set set notatino:
  L = {w belongs to sigma* | description of w}
  L = {w belongs {a,b,c}* | description of w}
  L = {x belongs {a, b}\* |all a's precede all bs}

# Lexicographic order

- shortest, within a length, dictionary order

- Dictionary order && no of chars ascending order

- enumeration is listing of all string

# Crdinaity of language

- the no of strings in lang
- smallest lang over any sigma is fi with cardinality 0

# fns of langs

- union, intersection, complement, diff
- lang fun:- concatenation, kleenestar
